# Changelog

## v0.5.0 — 2026-06-06

### Added
- `known_sources` check — fails if any citation or retrieved source is not present in a JSONL corpus manifest (exact path match). Controlled by `known_sources_manifest` (suite-level path) and `require_known_sources: true` (test-level flag).
- Manifest path resolution: relative paths in `known_sources_manifest` are resolved against the audit YAML file at run time, so the manifest can live next to the config.

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-31

### Added
- `corpus generate-tests` command for generating starter audit YAML from JSONL corpus manifests.
- Source coverage test generation from manifest paths.
- Risky filename test generation for source names containing terms like `secret`, `credential`, `password`, `token`, and `api_key`.
- Tenant-prefix test generation using `allowed_source_prefixes`.
- Deterministic generated YAML output that validates with `rag-agent-audit validate`.

### Notes
- Generated audit tests are starter templates and should be reviewed before running against a live endpoint.
- The command does not read document contents, index files, or run LLM calls.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows the spirit of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses semantic versioning once public releases begin.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-31

### Added
- `tenant_leakage` check — fails if any citation or retrieved source violates `allowed_source_prefixes` (prefix match) or contains a forbidden tenant ID (`forbidden_tenant_ids`, substring match). Both fields default to empty; the check is skipped when neither is configured.
- `corpus scan` command — streams matching files from a directory tree and writes a JSONL manifest (`ScanRecord` per line with path, size, extension, and optional tenant ID).
- `corpus stats` command — reads a JSONL manifest and prints a human-readable inventory: file counts by extension and tenant, duplicate basenames, risky-looking filenames, and largest files.
- Synthetic multi-tenant RAG test pack (`examples/multi-tenant-rag/`) with 12 deterministic test cases covering correct-tenant retrieval, cross-tenant isolation, credential elicitation, prompt injection echo, dangerous tool calls, out-of-corpus fallback, and the new `tenant_leakage` checks.
- OWASP LLM prompt injection test pack (`examples/prompt-injection/`) with 10 test cases targeting prompt injection echo, forbidden tool escalation, and system context leakage.

### Improved
- Terminal report now renders a compact summary table (Detail column capped at ~120 chars) followed by a full-diagnostics "Failed test details" section — long diagnostic messages no longer crowd the table.
- Corpus stats truncates display of duplicate basenames (first 20 groups, 5 paths each) and risky filenames (first 20) with "… and N more" summaries to keep output readable for large corpora.

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-28

### Added
- `init` command for generating starter audit configs from templates (`basic`, `flowise`, `fastapi`).
- `inspect` command for probing a live endpoint, detecting response fields, and suggesting JSONPath mappings.
- JUnit XML report output (`--format junit`) for CI systems that ingest test results directly.
- GitHub Actions step summary support (`--github-summary`) — appends a Markdown table to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
- Docker image support (`Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`) — run audits without a local Python environment.

### Improved
- Failure diagnostics: check messages now include a structured detail line, an answer preview, and an actionable suggestion for each failing check type.
- CLI test coverage using Typer's `CliRunner`.

### Notes
- `examples/flowise/` remains a local smoke and security-pattern integration example. It is not a vulnerability claim against Flowise.
